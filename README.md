Quora Question Pairs Shiny Application
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository includes a Shiny application that enables you to enter two questions and predict whether they are similar enough to be considered duplicates. The application is deployed at <https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/shiny-quora/>.

The [Keras](https://keras.rstudio.com) model used by the application was trained on the [Quora Question Pairs](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs) dataset. Design, training, and evaluation of the model is described in more detail at <https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/blog/keras-duplicate-questions-quora.html>.
